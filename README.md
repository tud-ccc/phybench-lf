Phybench with LinguaFranca
--------------------------

This is an implementation of the LTE Uplink Receiver PHY benchmark with the reactors model of computation.

The LTE PHY benchmark is a realistic implementation of the baseband processing for an LTE mobile base station.
For more infomation of the LTE PHY benchmark please refer to:

Reactors is a concurrent model of computation for reactive systems. More specifically we use LinguaFranca, a coordination language that implements the reactor model:
